Write a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next smaller positive integer containing the same digits.
For example:
next_smaller(21) == 12
next_smaller(531) == 513
next_smaller(2071) == 2017
Return -1, when there is no smaller number that contains the same digits. Also return -1 when the next smaller number with the same digits would require the leading digit to be zero.
